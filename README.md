## Getting started

Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

The image technique that inspired me is to include large number of particles, the particles can flow by its own direction and also changing the colour. By using this image technique, we can create lots of particles to represent the image used in main project and do some coding techniques that to let the particles flow in specfic curve, so the image will be more interactive and engaging. Considering the assignment criteria, it is essential to incorporate some suprising designs and I believe this image technique will be one of the best examples.

Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

One of the coding techniques used in part 1 is object-oriented programming (OOP). In OOP, code is organized into objects, which are instances of classes. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. In this code, an object-oriented approach is used to define and manage particles.By using OOP, the code becomes more organized, modular, and easier to understand. Each particle is treated as an independent object with its own state and behavior, making it scalable and maintainable.
